## Overview

This projects is about making an website that allows users to search through multiple stores. The website would let the user register and login to their own account.

## Core Goals 

:one:&nbsp; When I first visit the site, I'm on a home page that can search for various products.

:two:&nbsp; When not logged in, I see links to search, signup & login only. If I were to visit any of these routes manually while logged in, I would get redirected to the home page.

:three:&nbsp; I can create an account, log in, and log out.

:four:&nbsp; When logged in, I see links to home, logout, cart, and chart a user can also add items to cart and checkout. 

:five:&nbsp; The user can search for a specific product. Clicking on any product takes me to its details page.

:six:&nbsp; The cart will show a list of products the user added to cart
